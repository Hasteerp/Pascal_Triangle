# Pascal_Triangle
Write a C function named "triangle" that outputs Pascal’s triangle (for example) as follows:          In general the Pascal’s triangle can be represented as:       where nCr represents how many ways there are to choose r from n, not counting duplicates. In mathematics, it is usually presented as (n choose r). The formula used to calculate nCr can be written as:       where 𝑛! is the factorial of 𝑛.     The function triangle:  Is called by value where exactly one parameter (the number of rows of the Pascal’s triangle) is passed to it. Returns void (i.e. no value). Prints out the Pascal’s triangle to the standard output. Employs two other functions namely: int choose(int n, int r); That chooses r from n int factorial(int n); That calculates factorial of 𝑛. Note: You are allowed to use any other function as need be.     You are required to provide a complete C program by writing the code for the main() function  Prompts user to supply the number of rows in the Pascal’s triangle. Calls the function triangle such to display the Pascal’s triangle based on the number of rows provided by the user. Terminates the run of the program if the user supplies a negative value.    An example of the required output from your program is as follows:             Notes:  The number of the rows is limited to integers between 0 and 13 inclusive. Automarker tests inclusively between 0 and 13. If 0 then there are no triangles displayed. If negative integer then program terminates. The number displayed in the last column MUST be always displayed at the start of the line. Carefully calculate the spaces used between the numbers so that the numbers are properly aligned across rows. Use of a function spaces() that deals with spacing is recommended.
